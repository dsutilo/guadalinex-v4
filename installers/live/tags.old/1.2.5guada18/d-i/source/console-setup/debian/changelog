console-setup (1.7ubuntu19) edgy; urgency=low

  * If upgrading from an older version than this one, check for the Terminus
    font face and change it to VGA (if you do like it, you can change it
    back and it won't be touched again). If Terminus was in use, also check
    for the 12x6 font size and change it to 16, since that was apparently
    selected due to a strange use-of-debconf bug.
  * Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
    tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out of
    raw mode is a very bad idea (closes: Malone #66929; requires kbd 1.12-15
    or console-tools 1:0.2.3dbs-62ubuntu10).
  * Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian (closes: Malone #66774)
    and Japanese (closes: Malone #66719) layouts.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu18) edgy; urgency=low

  * Change the default font to VGA where supported; Terminus does not seem
    to have widespread aesthetic appeal.
  * Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese, and set the
    model to jp106 (closes: Malone #63915).
  * Build-depend on keymapper (>= 0.5.3-7) for improved Alt-handling logic.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu17) edgy; urgency=low

  * Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
    *_CA locales (closes: Malone #64418).
  * Install kbdnames-maker in /usr/share/console-setup, to make it easier
    for non-Perl programs to use KeyboardNames.pl.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 11 Oct 2006 12:52:36 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu16) edgy; urgency=low

  * Backport from trunk (Anton Zinoviev, closes: Malone #63921):
    - New mini-font georgian16.bdf to be used for the Georgian letters in
      Fixed16, author: Gia Shervashidze.  Thanks to Vladimer Sichinava.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  4 Oct 2006 11:37:15 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu15) edgy; urgency=low

  * Fix build failure caused by wrong path to KeyboardNames.pl.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  3 Oct 2006 15:44:59 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu14) edgy; urgency=low

  * Ship KeyboardNames.pl in /usr/share/console-setup.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  3 Oct 2006 11:09:27 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu13) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove obsolete XORGCONFIGFILE variable.
  * Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
    and you select a non-Latin layout (closes: Malone #63178).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  2 Oct 2006 14:47:58 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu12) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't run the init script (and thereby setupcon) on upgrade; just print
    a message telling you to run setupcon from a virtual console if you want
    to update your console configuration (closes: Malone #61723).
  * Update debian-installer/keymap handling from trunk (Anton Zinoviev).
    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been
    convinced that that is much less safe due to the prevalence of GNOME/KDE
    keymap overrides, and furthermore it made it more difficult to have
    ubiquity tell console-setup just to guess a default from the locale.
  * Drop the priority of the model and layout questions to medium if a
    configuration file already exists, since they'll have been asked at
    medium first time round and if we then ask them at critical the second
    time round they will be unexpectedly shown (closes: Malone #59883).
  * Backport from trunk:
    - config.proto: Handle properly the case when the user backs up from the
      first Debconf question.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sat, 23 Sep 2006 00:40:48 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu11) edgy; urgency=low

  * Fix default layout for Bosnian and default variant for Hindi.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 22 Sep 2006 15:57:23 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu10) edgy; urgency=low

  * console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
    'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
    perl-base (closes: Malone #60203).
  * Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
    console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
    console-setup/fontsize.
  * Don't set up the console font at boot time if usplash is running, since
    that seems to trigger a kernel bug that corrupts the usplash display
    (closes: Malone #60483).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 21 Sep 2006 01:01:54 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu9) edgy; urgency=low

  * Switch build-dependency and dependency back to xkb-data, now that it's
    fixed. Make the dependencies versioned until after Edgy is released to
    avoid problems with partially-upgraded systems where only the broken
    xkb-data is installed.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 13 Sep 2006 10:24:20 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu8) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add setupcon --force option and use it in postinst (Anton Zinoviev,
    http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-kbd-devel/2006-August/000278.html).
  * Check $DISPLAY rather than /proc/self/fd/2 in /etc/init.d/keyboard-setup
    and /etc/init.d/console-setup; use setupcon --force.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 11 Sep 2006 09:47:36 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Handle debian-installer/locale not being available (closes: Malone
    #59718).
  * Remove stray Keyboard/amiga.ekmap in source package.
  * Fix a potential infinite loop in the config script while moving past the
    variant question with an unsupported layout.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 10 Sep 2006 12:07:53 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu6) edgy; urgency=low

  * If there's no console-setup configuration when console-setup.config
    runs, then:
    - If there is an xorg.conf, set the defaults from there.
    - Failing that, if debian-installer/keymap is set, try to guess correct
      defaults from that using the same algorithm as formerly applied by
      xserver-xorg.config. The only serious change I made to the algorithm
      is that it now maps (mac-usb-)uk to plain gb, not gb(intl), since
      that's closer to what UK keyboard users generally expect.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  8 Sep 2006 00:13:26 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu5) edgy; urgency=low

  * Only call setupcon from postinst script if /lib/debian-installer exists,
    to make sure we're really in d-i. (Calling setupcon from X appears to
    make things rather messy.)

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 17:11:12 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove cs from the list of non-Latin layouts, as it has special
    per-variant handling.
  * Fix syntax error in config script.
  * Don't try to use the detect-keyboard plugin if running noninteractively.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 15:39:38 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of the
    pc105 model. (I tried building trees for the whole model, but this took
    far too long.)
  * If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
    (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
    detect the keyboard layout.
  * Fix debian/po/POTFILES.in to point to console-setup.templates.
  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-setup-fonts-udeb, at least for
    now.
  * Convert init script to LSB logging functions.
  * Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
    from kbd-chooser (/lib/debian-installer.d/S55console-setup,
    post-base-installer hook).
  * Temporarily build-depend and depend on just xkeyboard-config to work
    around Malone #59220.
  * Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
  * Remove unhelpful "none" defaults for several questions.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 09:18:42 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-tools-udeb.

 -- Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 23 Aug 2006 14:36:58 +0200

console-setup (1.7ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

  * Call setupcon with input and output from /dev/tty in postinst and make
    sure setupcon understands that properly.

  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of
    directories for keyboard data.  The data from /etc/console-setup/ckb
    are still the default.

    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.
  * Fix a shell syntax error in debian/config.proto that causes
    installation of console-setup to hang on powerpc.  Thanks to Colin
    Watson, closes: #374765.
  * ckbcomp: new option -compact to generate compact keymaps.
  * New experimental package console-setup-mini and udebs for d-i.
  * Correct a typo in the Bulgarian translation.  Thanks to Yavor Doganov,

console-setup (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.
  * Debconf: if there are unrecognised options, do not override the value
    of XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/console-setup.  Thanks to Javier Kohen,
    closes: #354473.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

console-setup (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the Debconf question for the font size add an information that some
    of the font sizes are non available in text mode and with radeonfb.
    Thanks to Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 12:22:04 +0200

console-setup (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make debconf templates a bit less verbose.  Make them compliant with
    writing style recommended in the developers references.  Thanks to
    Christian Perrier for the patch, closes: #352772.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 20:52:24 +0200

console-setup (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the Debconf config script not override the user's answers with
    default values when executed at postinst time.  Thanks to Juhapekka
    Tolvanen, closes: #352299.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:41:20 +0200

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:37:42 +0200

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Feb 2006 23:24:54 +0200
