Description: mount removable devices as normal user
 pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal
 users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. This
 provides a robust basis for automounting frameworks like GNOME's Utopia project
 and confines the amount of code that runs as root to a minimum.
 .
 This package also contains a wrapper "pmount-hal" which reads some
 information like device labels and mount options from hal and passes
 them to pmount. Install the package "hal" if you want to use this
 feature.
 .
 If a LUKS capable cryptsetup package is installed, pmount is able to
 transparently mount encrypted volumes.
