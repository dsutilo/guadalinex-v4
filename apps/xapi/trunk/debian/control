Description: Support for the so named "apt protocol" in Firefox
 Xapi is a perl script that uses synaptic to install packages from repositories.
 It can also, if called with a local route, install a single package. This
 packages add support for "apt protocol" in Firefox. When Firefox founds a
 apt:// link, it calls xapi with the url as argument.
