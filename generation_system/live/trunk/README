GLIG is a Guadalinex Live Image Generator


Description:

It means with this software you can generate a Live sytem based on Guadalinex
or Ubuntu (6.10 or higher).


NOTE: This is on a very early stage of the development so dont't expect an hole
and complex system. It's just starting, but soon it's be a fully operative
version.

How does it work?:

This is a common debian/ubuntu package wich depend of a few other packages
(syslinux, mkisofs, squashfs-tools, debootstrap and maybe another one). And
also is a python script who can be used automatically, by using a config
file, or on the fly, by passing options as parameters.

The process is... the script call to 'debootstrap' program indicating a 
few metapackages (the ones who make the difference berween the base system
and your distro) and their dependencies (which are automatically located
by the system itself).

What that means is the GLIG is going to create a fresh installation of
your distro in a directory from the packages repository you choice.

Once your distro is installed a directory, GLIG generate the compressed image
of it, and the rest of stuff you may need for a "Ubuntu alike" live system,
as the usplash and isolinux/gfxboot themes for the booting, the md5sum file
for the cd integrity checking and so on.
