== Kernel ==

 * linux [amd64 i386 ia64 sparc]

== Desktop ==

A small first step to comprehensive certification. Unfortunately, lsb
includes lsb-desktop, which pulls in both gtk and qt, so we pick individual
modules instead.

 * lsb-core
 * lsb-cxx
 * lsb-graphics

== Server ==

 * ssh
 * lilo [amd64 i386]   # MattZimmerman wants this for server admins; needed for LVM installs
 * ntp                 # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * ntp-simple
 * ntp-server
 * nfs-kernel-server   # need an NFS server
 * apache2-mpm-worker  # ThomMay; for simple file/web serving -> add zeroconf and we have swish mac os x style :-)
 * samba               # for Windows filesharing and integration
 * nis                 # allows Kickstart to configure NIS
 * postfix             # LaMontJones; our chosen mail server
 * ltsp-server-standalone # for LTSP-on-install
 * ltsp-client            # for LTSP-on-install
 * ldm 				   # seeded because its not a hard dependency of ltsp-client anymore

== Filesystems ==

 * xfsprogs
 * jfsutils
 * hfsplus [powerpc]  # ColinWatson
 * lvm2
 * mdadm
 * dmsetup

== Networking ==

 * mailx
 * mutt                # ThomMay; we need a basic mail client, this is the best-smallest

== NetworkManager ==

 * linux-headers-386 [i386]

== Common UNIX stuff ==

 * nfs-common		  # allows people to access NFS filesystems

== For X preconfiguration ==

 * xresprobe
 * laptop-detect
 * discover1
