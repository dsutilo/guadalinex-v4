GLIG is a Guadalinex Live Image Generator


Description:

It means with this software you can generate a Live system based on Guadalinex
or Ubuntu (6.10 or higher).

IMPORTANT: GLIG is definitive not a remaster system and neither an "I install
whatever I want, by hand, into a chrooted directory and customized, also by hand,
all the artwork stuff" system.
This is a packages based and repository oriented system.

NOTE: This is on a very early stage of the development so don't expect an hole
and complex system. It's just starting, but soon it's be a fully operative
version.

How does it work?:

This is a common Debian/Ubuntu package which depend of a few other packages
(syslinux, mkisofs, squashfs-tools, debootstrap and maybe another one). And
also is a python script who can be used automatically, by using a config
file, or on the fly, by passing options as parameters.

The process is... the script call to 'debootstrap' program indicating a 
few metapackages (the ones who make the difference between the base system
and your distro) and their dependencies (which are automatically located
by the system itself).

What that means is the GLIG is going to create a fresh installation of
your distro in a directory from the packages repository you choice.

Once your distro is installed a directory, GLIG generate the compressed image
of it, and the rest of stuff you may need for a "Ubuntu alike" live system,
as the usplash and isolinux/gfxboot themes for the booting, the md5sum file
for the cd integrity checking and so on.
