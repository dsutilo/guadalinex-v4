Description: Support for the so named "apt protocol" in Firefox
 Xapi is a perl script that uses synaptic to install packages from repositories.
 It can also, if called with a local route, install a single package. This
 packages add part of the support for "apt protocol" in Firefox. When Firefox
 founds an apt:// link, it calls xapi with the url as argument.
