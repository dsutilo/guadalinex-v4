  * When selecting a keymap from the F3 menu, set config.keymap directly

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.2.2) edgy; urgency=low

  * If available, play startup.mod sound on startup and accessv1.mod (etc.)
    when selecting accessibility menu items. However, this isn't working
    well in tests, so I've left it disabled by not shipping any .mod files.
    Anyone who would like to try to take this from here and figure out
    what's wrong would be welcome.
  * Improve keyboard navigation in accessibility menu: 0 selects None, and
    1, 2, etc. select other menu items in order (closes: Malone #39303).
  * Rename accessibility menu options to describe technology rather than use
    case, per Henrik (closes: Malone #58836).
  * Interpret gfxboot-access-options keyword in isolinux.cfg; for example,
    "v1 v2 m1" enables only the high contrast, magnifier, and keyboard
    modifiers options.
  * Re-enable access=m2 option (now "On-Screen Keyboard") by default.

  * Add/update translations from Rosetta: Afrikaans, Arabic, Belarusian,
    Bengali, Catalan, Kashubian, Danish, Esperanto, Spanish, Estonian,
    Basque, Persian, Filipino, Galician, Hindi, Croatian, Hungarian,

    to txt_menuitem_install_text, to avoid clashing with "Install to the
    hard disk" (closes: Malone #47615).
  * Move theme to /usr/share/gfxboot-theme-ubuntu, in line with other
    gfxboot-theme-* packages.

    - "Start (Ubuntu|Kubuntu|Edubuntu|Xubuntu)" -> "Start or install
      (Ubuntu|Kubuntu|Edubuntu|Xubuntu)".
    - "Install to first hard disk" -> "Install in text mode".
    Although it's a bit evil, I've unfuzzied all translations, on the basis
    that the existing translations are better than no translations.

  * Update locale-to-keymap mappings from console-keymaps-at
    2002.12.04dbs-52.1ubuntu3.
  * Don't map keys that are special when unshifted; this caused problems for
    the French keymap, and made it difficult in general to get out of a
    keymap you selected by accident (closes: Malone #31767).

  * Update language names from localechooser 0.27ubuntu4, adding Kazakh.
  * Fix encoding of Galician translation.
  * Update font to add characters necessary for Kazakh ("Қазақ").
  * Pass debian-installer/locale=pt_PT rather than just pt for Portuguese,
    allowing localechooser to do a better job of handling the preseeding
    (part of Malone #31477).
  * Teach setkeymap to try looking for a keymap based just on the language
    code in case it can't find it based on ll_CC.

    impaired users to read the menu labels.
  * Reduce the width of the keymap menu a bit by removing some unnecessary
    text from the German option.
  * Try to ensure that menus don't overflow the right-hand edge of the

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.0) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on the SuSE theme in gfxboot 3.2.5. Notable
    changes in this theme versus SuSE:
    - Remove "Christmas penguins" theme.
    - Remove driver update disk feature.
    - Remove boot loader splash; usplash should be able to provide
      everything we need along these lines.
    - Remove SuSE-specific images and sounds.
    - Drop back to just 640x480 modes (with a last-resort fallback to
      640x400x4), at least for now.
    - Use "splash.pcx" in the syslinux configuration directory as the
      background image if we find it. We'll use this for alternate
      Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu branding.
    - Interpret a subset of the syslinux simple menu configuration syntax in
      the isolinux configuration file to allow hiding menu items and setting
      human-readable labels.
    - Remove all help texts (which were SuSE-specific anyway); the intent is
      for this to be a generic theme and to put help texts elsewhere,
      probably in debian-installer. Disable the help panel item if no help
      texts are available.
    - Various visual rearrangements.
    - Use the installed version of getx11font rather than that in the
      grandparent directory.
    - Always show the full panel rather than having multiple modes.
    - Remove bizarre "move down one boot menu option the first time a key is
      pressed" weirdness.
    - Use subtler boot menu selection colours in place of inverse-video.
    - Change the font to GNU unifont, from the unifont package.
    - Update language codes and names from localechooser 0.22ubuntu2.
    - Include /usr/share/gfxboot/themes/Ubuntu/bootlogo.tar.gz, which can be
      unpacked directly into /isolinux on a CD rather than having to unpack
      and repack cpio archives.
    - Avoid mentioning the distribution name in "insert boot disk" messages.
