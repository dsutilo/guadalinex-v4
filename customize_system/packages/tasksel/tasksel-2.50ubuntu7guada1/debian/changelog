  * Add --debconf-apt-from and --debconf-apt-to options to tasksel. If
    provided, tasksel will use them to allocate regions of the
    debconf-apt-progress progress bar to task scripts.
  * Adjust desktop.preinst to allow use of debconf-apt-progress, and make
    its already-installed check a bit more robust. This isn't perfect
    because it uses the same progress bar endpoints for each package, so the
    progress bar will jump back and forth a little; but this is better than
    nothing.

    - bumped up lv for key package because less command or any other
      pager can't handle Japanese manpage.
    - took uim+anthy for default input method instead of canna.
      There is an alternative, "scim". But scim can't run on CUI.
    - removed ja-trans, doc-debian-ja, xmanpages-ja because they aren't
      maintained for a long time.
    - removed kterm and mlterm from desktop task. kterm can't support UTF8.
      mlterm has too huge dependencies and GNOME or KDE will provide a good
      UTF8 support terminal by default.

  * Add menu-xdg to gnome desktop task to enable Debian menus there.
  * Switch back to x-window-system-core until xorg reaches testing.
  * Rename the "Depends" field to "Enhances" which is much closer to what it's
    actually used for. A task such as french-desktop enchances systems with
    the desktop and french tasks installed on it.
  * Remove the old mozilla-firefox package from the desktop task, firefox is
    the new one & in testing now.
  * Run test scripts for enhancing tasks after task selection, to determine
    whether to install them.
  * kde-desktop task is back. Not installed as part of the desktop task, and
    still hidden from the menu. But:
  * Support preseeding tasks to install using the task name, which is shorter
    and nicer for preseeding than the short description. So for example,
    you can boot with tasksel/first=kde-desktop ..
  * Add kpackage to kde-desktop.
  * Move synaptic to gnome-desktop.
  * Add kdm to kde-desktop. Note that gdm is pulled in via gnome-desktop only.
  * Add a Provides field, this is used to let tasksel know if two alternate
    tasks, such as gnome-desktop and kde-desktop provide the same essential
    thing. If so, tasksel will try to avoid selecting both for install.
  * If an enhancing task is selected (by preseeding), make sure to select
    the tasks it enhances too. The add any other tasks that also enhnce
    those tasks, unless they provide the same thing. In other words, this
    allows preseeding kde-desktop, and getting desktop and any appropriate
    lang-desktop, but not gnome-desktop.

  * Add synaptic to desktop task, as it's very well suited to letting desktop
    users manage their software
  * Uncomment openoffice localised help packages, as their dependencies on
    openoffice.org have been weakened to suggests. So of the openoffice stuff
    commented out in 2.11, only openoffice.org itself remains as an arch all
    package depending on the arch any openoffice.org-bin.
  * Remove openoffice.org-gtk-gnome and openoffice.org-kde from greek-desktop
    as they not greek specific. But they do seem useful, so add them to
    desktop.
  * Split out kde and gnome stuff from desktop into kde-desktop and
    gnome-desktop.
  * Both depend on the main desktop task (so both will be installed if
    available when the desktop task is selected), and both are hidden since
    a user should not need to choose between them.
  * This allows CDs to leave off either KDE or Gnome (or both!) and still
    get a working desktop task.
  * It also allows derivitives to more easily choose to include only one of
    the environments (via preseeding or by unhiding the tasks).

    - Add libtheora0 to desktop task so totem can play these files.

      Anton Zinoviev. Closes: #271178
    - Add tf2pt1, ttf2pt1-chinese and ttfprint to chinese-s an chinese-t to
      support printing of asian fonts. Closes: #305148

      Chinese simplified yet. See #301496
    - Add scim-chewing and m17n-env to chinese-t-desktop, remove old cpanel
      and chinput input methods. Closes: #301496
    - Also remove language-env from chinese-s as it doesn't support that
      either, and remove obsolete cpanel from chinese-s-desktop too.
    - Add basic Arabic tasks. Closes: #282493
    - Add printconf to print-server for automatic printer setup. Closes: #293108

    - Look for desc files in /usr/local/share/tasksel too. Closes: #286170
    - Replace mozilla with firefox in desktop task. Closes: #282166
    - Add "force" test script contributed by Free Ekanayaka. This allows
      adding Test-force lines to tasks that force them to be installed,
      skipped, marked, or shown, without needing to write any code,
      and may be useful for CDDs. Closes: #275303
    - Allow later task descs to override earlier ones, useful if you
      want to blow away the standard Debian tasks, perhaps by using Test-force
      to hide them. Closes: #274936
    - Add a "new-install" test script (and export NEW_INSTALL for test
      scripts), to allow special control of tasks during new installs.
    - Add a new "standard" task which defaults to being marked for install
      on new installs and is otherwise hidden (because removing it makes
      little sense), and which causes all standard or above priority packages
      to be installed. Closes: #301273, #298702
    - Remove the -r, -i, and -s switches as unnecessary given the standard
      task.
    - Remove the -n switch since it was intended to be used with other removed
      switches.
    - Make the lang test only do anything on new installs, to avoid tasksel
      looking at the LANG variable in everyday use.
    - Rename Packages field in input task files to Packages-list to allow
      really specifying a Packages value.
    - Deal better with ctrl-c cancel while in debconf.

    - Tagged all the language tasks with Test-lang fields holding the
      language that the task is useful for, to allow for autoselection
      of languages matching the installation language.
    - Add fortune-mod to the desktop task as a gnome or kde screensaver does
      very silly things w/o it.
    - Adopted new, stricter criteria for task additions. Removed the following
      tasks, which did not meet it: c-dev, java-dev, python-dev, broadband,
      dialup, laptop, junior, kernel-compile, science, tex, games, lsb,

    - Added a conflicts with older debconf versions that do not work
      with tasksel.
    - Tasksel now accepts long options in addition to the short ones.
    - The -q option is not yet re-implemented, and I hope not to implement
      it, as to do so would mean a lot more messing with the package
      database. This breaks older base-config's, so conflict with them.
    - The -a option is also not yet re-implemented.

      tasksel enter a special mode more suited for initial system installs.

    - Added dnsmasq to the dialup task, since it is useful to have a caching
      name server, and dnsmasq is very easy to configure (and can block

      any more, and I cannot find a replacement.
    - Add a Norwegian language task from Petter Reinholdtsen. Closes: #205360

      which is the better choice, and continue to solicit comments on this
      change. Closes: #205358
    - Use apt-cache dumpavail via popen, instead of reading the often

  * Included a slighlty outdated tasks/po/de.po.
  * laptop: to support specific laptop HW, add tcp, mwavem, tpctl, 
    thinkpad-base, i8kutils, and sjog. vaiostat is left commented until

  * Remove gnome from desktop Key since neither the metapackage nor all of

    on some architectures. Closes: #202965
  * Stop #including the deps of packages in Key, since it's pointless and
    only makes it more fragile. #including in Packages is still ok.
  * Don't fail to build on missing key packages, since there might not be an
    apt cache to look at on some buildd's, or it might not include contrib.
  * The gnome-office metapackage vanished. The desktop task already includes
    koffice. OOo is still mired in contrib. Took the best of a bad lot and
    put OOo in as the only office software in the office task.
  * Commented out mozilla-locale-es as the package is currently broken.
  * Rene Engelhard
    - Make all the language tasks pull in OOo and kde langage packages
      consistently.
    - Replace toshutils with toshset which does not need X or a kernel
      interface.

    - Note in README that the way to get a task added is a bug report against
      this package. Closes: #144533
    - Removed broken python-bobo from python task. Closes: #180925
    - The python task is retargeted at providing a subset of the more useful
      python tools, instead of everything. Semi-randomly removed some stuff.
      Someone who uses python might want to take over maintainership of this
      task.
    - Capitalised first letter of every task, in an effort to look
      "professional". Closes: #183109
    - Removed the fortran task, not sufficiently used.
    - Added mutt and spamassassin to mail server task.

    - Replace netenv (with its nasty boot-time prompt) with guessnet (with
      its slick new ifupdown integration) in laptop task.
    - Add hdparm to laptop task, since many laptop users will want to use it
      to speed up (or turn off!) their disks. Closes: #87450
    - Add menu to office task.
    - Added a java task. Closes: #108061
    - Removed inlined Spanish translation of spanish task. However we should
      add translations, it's not like that!
    - Added a Thai task. Closes: #122663. Needs review since the bug's package
      list was 2 years old.
    - Cleaned up bad wording in most of the descriptions of the
      language-specific tasks.
    - Added sudo to unix-server.
    - Added kernel-compile task for custom kernel building. Closes: #184428
    - Blessed the idea of putting Maintainer fields in individual task files.
    - Removed nonexistant packages from tasks: netscape-zh-resource-477, 
      dialdcost, hanterm, tktabble-dev
    - Put cxterm-ks in korean task to replace hanterm. I hope that's right.
    - Rename mozilla-locale-es to mozilla-locale-es-es.
    - For chinese-t, use doc-linux-zh-text, which provides traditional
      chinese. doc-linux-zh-t went away.
    - doincludes.pl and makedesc.pl use apt-cache dumpavail instead of
      dselect available file, for more up-to-date information.
    - Shortended the description of c-dev.
    - Renamed Essential field to Key, to prevent confusion.
    - Implemented dropping of tasks that are missing key packages.
    - Enhanced listpackages.pl with support for listing key packages.
    - makedesc.pl too.
    - Key packages do not need to be listed under Packages too.
    - Updated tcl/tk to 8.4.
    - Removed localces from language tasks; language-env depends on it.
    - Changed around what is Key and what is not, more changes than I can
      record here.
    - Don't expand lsb package's deps, we want the whole thing or nothing.
    - Added makeoverride.pl, which will generate an override file from a
      directory of task files.
    - Remove user-de and user-es, language-env superscedes.
    - Back to just gimp for desktop task.
    - If a task is not in the task desc files, but is in the available file
      as a Task: line, do not display it.

      Also removed a few things like lynx from the task.
    - added aviword to desktop, so there is a basic word processor in there
    - added gimp to desktop too, it's too handy not to be there
    - added lyx to tex
  * New tasks by Joey Hess:
    - web-server -- currently includes only the bare basics, suggestions
      appreciated.
    - unix-server -- a conventional unix server, fully loaded with most of
      the standard unix daemons and userland for console users.

    - number this like a Debian package

tasksel (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications to existing tasks:
    - Replaced talk of "this [meta]package" with "this task", and like
      changes.
    - In l10n tasks, s/-speaking// for consistency.
    - Make all l10n tasks include locales. It's in base, so this is of
      dubious utility, but some had it and some not.
    - Changed short descriptions of basic-desktop and desktop in an attempt
      to clarify how they're different.
    - Added some comments here and there for unresolved issues.
    - Largely rewrote Debian Jr. descriptions.
    - Added menu to desktop task.
    - Rejiggered mail-server, to be a general purpose mail server, not just
      imap.
    - Moved samba-server to file-server, and made that include nfs stuff
      too.
    - Added a print-server task, that also includes samba, along with other
      stuff.
    - Killed debian-dev(el) task, since it does not meet our task criteria
      -- nowhere near 10% of debian users are debian developers (we hope!),
      and probably not enough regular users will use this package to make
      up the difference. This is my own package, so I'm willing to be
      persuaded otherwise, though..
    - Removed misc window managers from the desktop task. It is unnecessary
      to list them there, since anXious will let the user choose.
    - Killed the demo tasks.
    - Went for consistent capitalization of the short descriptions. Just
      capitalize proper names. I'm not sure if I like this effect, we may
      want to capitalize the first word of each description too.
    - Sundry other changes of little note.
  * Replaced several occurrances of "task packages" with "tasks" elsewhere
    in tasksel.
  * Added -a switch, to show all tasks, even empties. Mostly useful before
    we get tasks into the Packages files, for a global overview of how the
    system will eventually look.
  * Added lint check to makedesc.pl -- it will warn at build time
    about tasks that list unavailable packages. This caught several
    references to virtual packages, etc already, that need to be fixed..
  * VERSION in Makefile automatically tracks this changelog.

  * Joey Hess:
    - Added support for task description files.
    - Read in /usr/share/tasksel/debian-tasks.desc as a task description
      file.
    - Added makedesc.pl, a program to generate a task description file from
      a set of task descriptions.
    - Got rid of all the name prettification code since it is no longer used
      anyway.
    - Killed filterdescription, the task packages in woody actually don't
      have that problem anymore.
    - Don't move cursor to the right after a task is selected.
    - Removed unused tasksel.man from source package (keep pod).
    - Fixed an obscure bug if a task package happened to be the last thing in
      the available file.
    - Enable debug mode by default, but turn it off when building from the
      rules file.

  * Anthony Towns:
    - Fix memory allocation bug when do a fake task- package
    - Port most of the interesting tasks to the tasks file.
    - Fix makedesc.pl to cope with +'s in a task name (c++-dev)

    hardcoded list of default sections, with a defined order; remaining
    sections get added to the end, in alphabetical order. Sections that
    don't match "tasks-*" are ignored.

  * "tasksel install foo bar baz" as a replacement for "apt-get install
    task-foo task-bar task-baz"

  * Increase the size of the "apt-get install" command line buffer.

tasksel (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support "Task:" headers to include a package in a task.
    .
    Syntax is:
        Package: foo
        Task: bar, baz, quux
    .
    Note that tasks still require a task-* package in order to have a
    description. Frontends could conceivably treat a task-foo package
    being installed as meaning "automatically install new packages with
    a Task: foo field, but don't worry about old packages that weren't
    installed", similar to dselect's Standard handling, I think.
    .
