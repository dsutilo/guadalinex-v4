<h3>Generic</h3>

<ol>

<li>
<b>DeVeDe is very slow compared to Mencoder alone!</b>
<p>By default, Mencoder uses <i>fast</i> options, but DeVeDe uses <i>high quality</i> options.
If you want speed, just go to the tab <i>Quality options</i> (in the
<i>Advanced options</i> section) and there disable <b>Trellis</b> and choose <b>Use MBCMP</b>. Now DeVeDe
should be as fast as Mencoder with default options.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Why can't I use a VFAT/FAT32 partition to create my DVDs?</b>
<p>VFAT and FAT32 file systems doesn't understand uppercase/lowercase letters, and shows everything in
lowercase. Unfortunately, the creation of a DVD tree is case sensitive.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>DeVeDe does not start in windows</b>
<p>First you need python 2.5. Then you have to make sure you have gtk for windows installed. It is more easy
to get the Gtk+/Win32 Development Environment (runtime, devel, docs, glade) version. Then you need pygtk.
Now you need to install python 2.5 extension pywin32. Any of the needed programs such as mplayer that are
not already installed should now be automatically installed next time you run mplayer. Or you can wait for
a win32 installer to be made (any voluteers in the room?).</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>I can't add more than 12 titles</b>
<p>That's the current limit for DeVeDe, to allow to use one single menu. With more titles there should
be need more than one page for the menus. But if people really, really need it, I'll implement it.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Subtitles</h3>

<ol>

<li><b>I preview a video with subtitles and the text looks bad (text colors are inverted)</b>
<p>Don't worry, it's a bug of MPlayer when showing DVD subtitles from a file instead of a true DVD.
In the final disk they will look fine.</p>
</li>

<li><b>I preview a video with subtitles, but it doesn't show the subtitles...</b>
<p>Some Mplayer/Mencoder versions seems to fail to show the subtitles when you watch an MPEG file from
hard disk, but they are there. SVN versions seems to have this fixed.</p></li>

<li><b>I dislike the font used to render the subtitles. How can I change it?</b>
<p>Just choose a TrueType font you like and copy it in $HOME/.spumux directory, renaming it to
<b>devedesans.ttf</b>.</p>
</li>

<li><b>I tried to create a DivX file with subtitles, but in the tab it says it's not possible. How can
I add subtitles to a DivX?</b>
<p>DivX format doesn't allow embedded subtitles, but nearly all software players (MPlayer, VLC...) and a
lot of hardware players can render them on-demand if you put the file with the subtitles in the same
directory than the movie, and rename the former with the same name than the later (this is, if your movie
file is MYMOVIE.AVI and your subtitles are in .SRT format, just put the subtitles file in the same directory
and rename it to MYMOVIE.SRT). The player should allow you to enable/disable them with the
same button used for DVD subtitles.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Menus</h3>

<ol>

<li><b>I created a DVD with two titles, but when I insert it in my player there's no menu, so I can watch
only the first one. How can I watch the second?</b>
<p>Be sure that you have checked the option <b>Add a menu with the titles</b>.</p>
</li>

<li><b>How can I add a menu to a VCD/SVCD/CVD?</b>
<p>Currently you can't with DeVeDe.</p>
</li>

<li><b>The menus created by DeVeDe are simplistic. Will you add a menu editor to allow to create more
complex menues?</b>
<p>Probably not. My intention is to maintain DeVeDe as an easy-to-use tool. If you want to create complex
menues you have excellent tools like <a href="http://dvdstyler.sourceforge.net/">DVD Styler</a>,
<a href="http://qdvdauthor.sourceforge.net/">Q DVD Author</a> or
<a href="http://polidori.sourceforge.net/">PoliDori</a>.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<ol>

<li><b>I tried to create a disk but the sound is pure noise.</b>
<p>Version 1.0-rc1 of MPlayer/Mencoder (the one released, at least at April 20, 2007 with Ubuntu Feisty
and other Linux distributions) is buggy and doesn't work fine. While they don't launch a fixed release,
just download the file <b>mplayer_fixed</b> from DeVeDe's homepage and follow the instructions there. Or,
if you are brave and experimented, you can compile MPlayer/Mencoder from SVN.
</li>

<li><b>DeVeDe fails to create watchable videos, or makes a 0-byte ISO file</b>
<p>Be sure that you are using the last version of MPlayer/Mencoder (at least 1.0Pre8, but later is better).
The very common version 1.0Pre7 has some bugs that can lead to problems with DeVeDe. But warning with
version 1.0-rc1.</p>
</li>

<li><b>I receive an error when I try to create a DIVX/MPEG4 file</b>
<p>Be sure that your MPlayer/Mencoder version is compiled with MP3lame support. The creation of DIVX files
needs it.</p></li>

<li><b>DeVeDe still fails. How can I report a bug?</b>
<p>Open a terminal and launch DeVeDe with this command:</p>
<p><div style="text-align: center;">devede &gt; output.txt &nbsp; 2&gt;&amp;1</div></p>
<p>When it fails (or when it fully ends), take the files OUTPUT.TXT and XXXXXX.XML (you will find the later
in the destination directory), and send both to <b>raster@rastersoft.com</b>.</p>
</li>
