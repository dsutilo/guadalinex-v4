gnome-orca (0.2.0+cvs.06.02.16-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

This is the first Ubuntu release of orca, please note:

 * It was named gnome-orca to not conflict with the already existing 
   "orca - Router Monitoring and Graphing System"
 * You need to run orca --setup to first time configurations.
