  * Use update-initramfs -c -k "$(uname -r)" rather than update-initramfs

  * Fix incorrect loop variable reuse in do_remove, and attempt multiple
    broken package resolution passes while removing packages (closes: Malone
    #66406).
  * Detect existing HFS bootstrap partitions during automatic partitioning
    and take account of them while validating mountpoints (closes: Malone
    #66384).
  * Fix crash on keyboard page if you select a layout with no variants.
  * Remove kernels before running update-initramfs so that we update the
    correct initramfs on powerpc. Make sure to fix up kernel/initrd symlinks
    after running update-initramfs, so that we have something to which to
    point the initrd symlink.

    "(hd0)") or start with "/dev/" (closes: Malone #62479).
  * Exclude Dzongkha and Khmer from the language list for now, as we don't
    ship fonts for them and we don't have enough installer translations yet

  * Back out orca change from 1.2.0: it doesn't work properly because the
    orca process running as the calling user needs to be killed first. At

ubiquity (1.1.30) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add /usr/lib/ubiquity/console-setup/locale wrapper that overrides the
    output of locale with the value of debian-installer/locale if set; this
    encourages console-setup to select an appropriate keyboard layout
    (closes: Malone #60067).

  * Run partman-commit while generating the installation summary to make
    sure that we have a partitioning summary even for manual partitioning

    past the confirmation question.
  * Don't reset the locale or run localechooser again if the country
    selected on the timezone page isn't one for which we have a locale in
    the current language (closes: Malone #61387).

  * KDE frontend: Unload the kded medianotifier while committing
    partitioning changes (closes: Malone #48051).
  * KDE frontend: Convert to allow_change_step/allow_go_forward system from
    GTK frontend so that the back and next buttons are more consistently
    enabled/disabled. Hide the back button on the first page.
  * Forbid going back or forward when the UI is already processing a
    previous back or forward action (closes: Malone #54163 and lots of
    duplicates).
  * GTK frontend: Disable back and forward buttons while gparted is starting
    up. Requires gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu11).
  * GTK frontend: Avoid calling gtk.main_quit if a main loop isn't running,
    as further insurance against Malone #54163.
  * Fix various bugs when mounting source filesystems natively rather than
    relying on casper to have mounted them already (closes: Malone #64348).

    out what filename they relate to, and display a useful error message
    explaining that this is probably a CD or hard disk fault (as
    appropriate) and how to deal with this. Closes about a million bugs.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Build-depend on po-debconf (>= 1.0) for new translation-handling
    features.
  * Add a FAQ about backporting to doc/README.
  * Document ubiquity/install/filesystem-images in doc/README.
  * autogen.sh: Force use of automake-1.8 and aclocal-1.8.
  * Move auxiliary autotools files to a build subdirectory.
  * Add a check to debian/rules to remind me to bump the version number in
    configure.ac.
  * Read partition flags from gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu9). Display an
    error on the mountpoints page if running on powerpc and there is no HFS
    partition with the boot flag set. Treat HFS partitions with the boot
    flag set as NewWorld bootstrap partitions (closes: Malone #43768).
  * GTK frontend: Add a keyboard variant selector (closes: Malone #61729).
    (The same needs to be done for the KDE frontend.)
  * Remove old kbd-chooser component, which won't be usable any more.
  * Send stderr to /var/log/installer/debug if UBIQUITY_DEBUG is set.
  * Send DEBCONF_DEBUG=filter output to stderr, not syslog; it should be
    interleaved with DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer output.
  * GTK frontend: Throw away stderr from gnome-screensaver-command; it
    outputs far too much rubbish and confuses users.
  * KDE frontend: Fix reboot dialog button handling (closes: Malone #62765).
  * Replace the rather jittery time-remaining message while copying files
    with a message that appears when there's less than a minute remaining
    (closes: Malone #61514).

  * Mark console-setup/layout and console-setup/variant as unseen before
    starting console-setup, to avoid incorrect variant choices (although I
    think there's also a console-setup bug here in that the variants are
    being substituted in the wrong order).
  * Depend on a version of console-setup without the misguided
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf handling.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: partman-target 45ubuntu3.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 26 Sep 2006 23:29:53 +0100

ubiquity (1.1.23) edgy; urgency=low

    capability is set (closes: Malone #48005).
  * Don't crash if a progress bar is set up to have the same start and end
    points (closes: Malone #56789).
  * Fix timezone component to deal with frontend.get_timezone returning None
    (closes: Malone #42865).
  * Use more sensible default cities for languages with country shortlists
    (i.e. the intended default rather than the first in alphabetical order
    of country code), working around a missing feature in debconf.
  * Pick a sensible default city for countries with multiple zones but no
    explicit default city (closes: Malone #43914).
  * Remove obsolete Recommends: gparted from ubiquity; ubiquity-frontend-gtk
    already depends on it.
  * Feed not-yet-formatted partition state back into gparted when starting
    it up, so that newly-created partitions aren't listed as "unknown" when
    you go back (requires gparted 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu8; closes: Malone #40404).
  * Fix use of gobject.spawn_async in
    gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command, broken in 1.1.19.
  * Make sure that "Restart now" is the default option on the final dialog
    (closes: Malone #61517).
  * Log warnings in various cases when partitions are ignored on the
    mountpoints page.
  * GTK frontend: For some reason GtkTable doesn't seem to queue a resize
    itself when you attach children to it, so the mountpoints table was
    showing up blank the first time through. Worked around this.
  * Add/update translations from Rosetta: Arabic, Belarusian, Bulgarian,
    Breton, Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, Basque, Finnish, French, Hindi,
    Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Georgian, Korean, Kurdish, Latvian,
    Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, Occitan, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian,

    POSIX semantics are required (closes: Malone #48410).

  * Ignore failures from os.utime on directories. I don't know why I get a
    disproportionate number of reports of this failing, but to be honest I
    don't care enough about directory timestamps to investigate.
  * Add trivial pid file locking, allowing ubiquity to exit gracefully if
    you try to run more than one instance of it at once; previously it blew
    up much more spectacularly upon finding that the debconf database was
    locked (closes: Malone #46569).
  * Run gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command with LC_ALL=C to

    still need to add a UI element for the keyboard variant, and
    translations of layout and variant names are missing, but it mostly
    seems to work.
  * Strip Fonts and Keyboard directories from our copy of console-setup;
    they're very large, and not needed since we don't actually build
    console-setup, but just copy a few scripts from it.
  * Add a ubiquity/install/filesystem-images template, which can be

    space-separated images are given, then they will be overlaid using
    unionfs
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/live-cd-stacked-filesystems).
  * Unset DEBIAN_HAS_FRONTEND in apt-install to make sure that debconf-using

  * Remove several obsolete functions from ubiquity.misc.
  * Fix misc.ex to use subprocess.call properly rather than smashing
    arguments together and invoking them via the shell.
  * Remove duplicate logging from Install.chrex.
  * Remove /var/log/installer/syslog from all error messages etc., as
    everything goes to /var/log/syslog now. /var/log/syslog is now copied to
    /var/log/installer/syslog on the target system.
  * Automatically set UBIQUITY_NO_GTK or UBIQUITY_NO_KDE to disable building
    frontends as appropriate if tools are missing (pygtk-codegen-2.0 for the
    GTK frontend, kdepyuic for the KDE frontend). This should never happen
    in normal builds, but saves typing when building test versions.
  * Teach DebconfFilter to send escaped replies when CAPB escape is set.
  * Fix substitution variable for full name in ubiquity/summary.
  * I never really understood the whole control flow around the summary
    page, and I wrote it! Take advantage of the partman-commit script added
    in partman-base 90ubuntu4, so that instead we shut down partman, run the
    summary page, and then start it back up to commit changes. The
    PartmanCommit component is now used for both automatic and manual

  * Fix typoed variable name while raising InstallStepError.
  * Rename Partman component to PartmanAuto to allow for a future all-in-one
    partman component
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/ubiquity-advanced-partitioner).
  * When an error occurs with the install progress bar up, only return to
    autopartitioning if the partitioner is still running.
  * Turn DebconfInstallProgress upside-down so that the main process handles
    apt installation and the subprocess handles the translation of apt
    status messages into debconf protocol messages, rather than the other
    way round. The previous approach resulted in exceptions from apt ending
    up in the wrong process.
  * Silence apt errors while installing language packs, since we ignore them
    anyway.
  * Point apt at /target/var/lib/dpkg/status rather than
    /var/lib/dpkg/status (closes: Malone #47859).
  * Handle new initramfs-tools configuration directory.
  * Set debconf's escape capability when fetching extended descriptions,
    since they're potentially multi-line.
  * Use partman's confirmation message rather than generating it ourselves,
    now that its use of multi-line SUBSTs has been fixed (closes: Malone
    #47043).
  * Make the rest of the summary text translatable.
  * Display grub-installer/install_to_xfs question if it's asked.
  * Fix get_filesystems() not to assume ext3 in quite so many situations.
  * Detect XFS for validation purposes even when it wasn't just formatted by
    gparted/qtparted (closes: Malone #53642).
  * Fix all mentions of gparted in the KDE frontend.
  * Leave existing newworld boot partitions alone when committing manual

  * If gparted or qtparted crashes, put up a dialog allowing the user to try
    again, return to autopartitioning, or quit the installer. This is a
    pretty awful hack, but hopefully we won't be using gparted/qtparted for

ubiquity (1.1.0) edgy; urgency=low

  * Use try/finally in install.py to ensure that PROGRESS STOP is always
    called; ignore errors from PROGRESS STOP (e.g. because debconf has gone
    away due to a previous error).
  * Support /UNIONFS (Knoppix) as well as /rofs as the read-only filesystem
    source.
  * Don't require entering a full name (see
    http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/os-install-experiences-part-4-ubuntu).

    attach your details to an existing bug.
  * Add passwd and adduser dependencies from user-setup.
  * Take a copy of the supplied choice map in set_keyboard_choices.
  * Save tracebacks from install.py and slurp them back into the traceback
    displayed if install.py exits non-zero.
  * Convert to new Python policy (python-central). Install Python
    modules/extensions to /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity rather than into the
    public module path.
  * Warn in the partitioner if you try to use XFS for /boot (closes: Malone
    #47848).
  * Warn in the partitioner if system filesystems are not reformatted
    (closes: Malone #47046).
  * Remove /usr/bin/espresso compatibility symlink.
  * Use os._exit() rather than sys.exit() in the apt install progress child
    process after forking, fixing a lot of strange "PROGRESS STOP" messages
    in /var/log/installer/syslog and bizarre debconf exceptions. See also
    Malone #53298.

    (under d-i/source/), build them as part of our build process, and
    include all the components in the espresso binary package. 'debian/rules
    update' can be used to do automatic updates of these copied source
    packages. This should ultimately simplify maintenance work as well as
    making it much easier for third parties to make local changes to this

  * GTK frontend:
    - Remove bogus hostname, fullname, and name instance variables; fix
      get_hostname() method.
    - Pass desired filesystem type from gparted to partman (closes: Malone
      #34921). Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+11).
  * Fix logging functions not to use eval, so that they don't break when
    asked to log something containing "'" characters.
  * Add part_devices instance variables to the GTK and KDE frontends to
    avoid horribleness when trying to map a partition label back to a device
    name.
  * Perform network configuration: we copy /etc/network/interfaces and
    /etc/resolv.conf, write /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts afresh based on the
    selected hostname, and write /etc/iftab afresh based on the interfaces
    present (closes: Malone #33064). Eventually most of this should be
    replaced by a call to netcfg, but that's difficult at the moment.
  * Add explicit text with a language question to the language screen
    (closes: Malone #36973).

  * KDE frontend:
    - merge with GTK, adds disk selection page

  * Make life easier for components called from Install: support extra
    environment variables returned from prepare(), and allow an existing
    Debconf instance to be passed in the constructor.

espresso (0.99.35) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix estimated install copying time. We no longer use cpio to do the
    copying, but instead do the whole thing in-process. This lets us avoid
    buffering issues.
  * Avoid a long pause without any info message while updating apt's indices
    before downloading language packs.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Enlarge primary text in progress windows, per the GNOME HIG.
    - Turn debconf progress dialog into a normal progress window, since it
      doesn't have any buttons.
    - Allow the label above the keyboard test box to wrap.
  * Update translations for most languages from Rosetta.

  * GTK frontend:
    - Remove remaining Spanish strings. Make some of these translatable
      using existing strings in partman; the rest will follow later.
    - In manual partitioning, only mark partitions automatically mounted on
      swap, /, /usr, /var, or /boot to be reformatted by default.
    - Honour the desired type of a filesystem newly created in gparted in
      preference to its current detected type.
    - If a newly-created filesystem is selected, disable the Reformat
      checkbox and force it on, as it makes no sense off.
  * Exempt swap from duplicate mountpoint checks (part of Malone #34465).
  * Fix crash when reporting that a partition is too small.
  * Make the estimated install copying time a bit less madly wrong (it was
    estimating based on the total file size rather than the amount left to
    copy), although I think buffering on cpio's stdin is still causing it to
    be pretty badly out most of the time.

    kbd-chooser when the selection is changed.
  * Fix choices_display_map to work correctly and map to the other value
    instead of being an identity map.

    - Translate window title immediately when changing language.
    - Make title of install progress bar translatable.
    - Make sure that cancelling the installation at the summary page cancels
      partman too.
    - Make "Installation complete" translatable.
  * Make sure that debconffilter never tries to call the same widget more
    than once for a single command.
  * Move more frontend-independent translation logic from the GTK frontend
    to espresso.misc so that other frontends can use it.

    - Move partitioning committal into the main installation progress bar.
  * Remove text resizing based on the screen size, which as well as being
    annoying was also implemented in a way that made our lives difficult for
    internationalisation.
  * Add internationalisation support for those strings that don't come from
    d-i, with translations stored in debconf templates. I've only set this
    up in the GTK frontend so far, but it should be straightforward to do
    elsewhere. Requires espresso-locale (>= 0.27ubuntu11).

    - Change the summary text box to a selectable label so that it gets the

      locale.
  * GTK and KDE frontends:
    - Move the keymap page after the location page, so that in future the
      keymap page can be initialised using data for the selected country.
  * Make espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo.dst() pretend that DST is not in effect if
    we have no DST information, rather than returning the more correct None;
    this allows fromutc() to be used reliably.

    - Show the current time in the selected timezone on the location page.
    - Translate more strings from Spanish to English.
    - Use HH:MM for UTC offsets rather than fractions of hours.
    - Refer to UTC offsets as GMT offsets instead; it's not quite 100%
      accurate, but (we think) more widely understood.
    - Add a border around the timezone map.
    - Change identification page heading to "Who are you?".
    - Reorganise locale page so that the language select box is in the
      middle rather than at the left-hand side, and shorter.
    - Drop the notebook border.
    - Remove the expander and the "Details" label from the summary page, per
      feedback from the UI sprint.
    - Make the first click on the timezone map zoom in but not select a
      city; the second click will select a city.

espresso (0.99.18) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rip all the /target unmounting code out of espresso.backend.copy and do
    it in the main espresso program just before exiting.
  * Parse /proc/mounts for mountpoints to unmount; this saves having to have
    a get_mountpoints method in every frontend.
  * Unmount /target before starting the frontend, since we will behave badly
    if /target is still mounted from a previous installation attempt.

  * Handle all PROGRESS commands entirely in debconffilter, without passing
    them through to the debconf frontend.
  * Add a PROGRESS REGION extension to debconffilter, and a ProgressPosition
    class to keep track of progress bar regions; allows a single progress
    bar to be subdivided into pieces for different stages.
  * Hack FilteredCommand.run_command() to execute the command without any
    debconffiltering glue if frontend is None; this allows nested
    FilteredCommands to more or less work.
  * Stop FilteredCommand.error() from running a UI loop; we assume that the
    frontend's error_dialog() method runs synchronously.

  * Move espresso/components/summary to a new scripts directory.
  * Rework copy and configuration progress bars using debconffilter. This
    fixes some responsiveness bugs, allows for localisation, and finally
    unifies all progress bar handling.
  * Add debconf template translation boilerplate.

  * Move call_gparted from espresso.backend.part into the GTK frontend, as
    it's widget-set-dependent. Unhardcode the path to gparted.
  * Remove espresso/backend/, none of which is used any more except by the
    netcloner and noui frontends which are both broken at the moment anyway.
    The frontend/backend division is now between espresso.frontend and
    espresso.components, mediated by debconffilter.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk Architecture: any, due to the Evolution map
    widget (closes: Malone #32874).
  * Build Evolution map widget and Python bindings with -fPIC; should fix
    build failure on amd64.
  * Only enable the TimezoneMap.flash_selected_point handler when the
    timezone map is visible.
  * Remove text that claims /home will not be formatted; partly fixes Malone
    #32534.
  * Display an error dialog on GRUB installation failures (closes: Malone
    #32047; grub has been seeded, so this shouldn't generally happen any
    more anyway).
  * Notice and exit on errors from the copy and configuration stages.

    messages appear there more quickly during testing.
  * Fix debconffilter to handle SET and SUBST commands whose values consist
    of more than one word.
  * Add a "Ready to install" summary page. (It doesn't contain all the
    necessary information yet, and it should run before partitioning is
    committed rather than after, but that will be easy to fix later.)

  * Add a language page, using espresso-locale. The locale is set in the
    target system and used for debconf coprocesses, although not yet for
    translatable strings in the Espresso core.
  * Add a FilteredCommand.cleanup() hook that can be overridden by

  * Add a non-blocking mode to debconffilter, and watch the filter's input
    from the GTK main loop. This allows the GTK user interface to update

    it's unnecessarily painful to actually display them to the user.
  * Reduce log noise in configuration stage.
  * Try to disable gnome-volume-manager's automounting while mounting

  * Use the new stdio control interface in gparted 0.1-0ubuntu2 to apply
    changes when going forward from the manual partitioning screen, undo

espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
