<p>Current version: 3.1b</p>

<p>Before sending a bug, please read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>. (thanks).</p>

<p><h2>What is it?</h2></p>
<p>DeVeDe is a program that allows you to create a video DVD from an MPEG, AVI, MOV... video file,
suitable for home DVD players. DeVeDe uses <b>Mplayer</b>, <b>Mencoder</b>, <b>DVDAuthor</b> and
<b>VCDimager</b>, so you can use any video playable with Mplayer.</p>
<p>
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

</p>
<p><h2>Installing DeVeDe</h2></p>
<p>To install DeVeDe, first you must ensure you have <b>Mplayer</b>, <b>Mencoder</b>, <b>DVDAuthor</b>
and <b>VCDimager</b> in your system. You need Python 2.4, PyGTK and PyGlade too.
Then, just run the <b>install.sh</b> script as root:</p>
<p><div style="text-align: center"><h3><b>sudo ./install.sh</b></h3></div></p>

<p>It will copy all the files at the right place. It should even create an entry in your
Gnome/KDE/freedesktop-compatible-windowmanager menu.</p>

<p>For advanced users, there are some extra paremeters that you can pass to the install.sh script (thanks to
Patrick Monnerat). These are the <i>--targeted=(yes/no)</i>, <i>--uninstall=(yes/no)</i>, and the more common
ones (<i>--DESTDIR=...</i>, <i>--prefix=...</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>--targeted</i> parameter means that you want to install DeVeDe in a directory different than /usr/local.
If you put it to <b>yes</b> you must use <i>--DESTDIR=</i> and <i>--prefix=</i> at least to specify where to
store the files.</p>

<p>The <i>--uninstall</i> parameter was a ned due to a mistake in the first versions of DeVeDe. Up to version
2.8, the <i>install.sh</i> script installed DeVeDe in /usr, but starting from version 2.9 it used /usr/local.
To avoid problems when an user updates from a version lower than 2.9 to a higher one, by default the <i>install.sh</i>
script first uninstall DeVeDe from all possible locations (/usr and /usr/local), and then proceed with the
installation itself. This is a good effect until you want to create a .deb or .rpm package. In this case, just
add the <i>--uninstall=no</i> parameter and the <i>install.sh</i> script will only do the install process,
skipping the previous uninstall.</p>

<p>So if you are a package developer, you should use a command line like:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center">./install.sh --uninstall=no --targeted=yes --DESTDIR=/var/tmp/blahblah
--prefix=/usr</div></p>

<p><h2>Description of the interface</h2></p>

<h3>The selection window</h3>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="choose.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>When you launch DeVeDe, it will show you this window, asking what kind of disk you want to create.
You can choose between:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Video DVD: a classic video DVD, like the ones you rent in your videoclub or buy in your video shop.</li>
<li>VideoCD: a CD with CBR MPEG-1 video at a resolution of 352x240 pixels (352x288 with PAL), a fixed bitrate
of 1152 kbits/second for video and 224 kbits/second for audio. The quality is comparable to analog VHS,
and a CD can contain as much compressed audio/video than uncompressed audio (this is, a 80-minutes CD
can contain about 80 minutes of compressed video/audio). Is compatible with all DVD players, but video
quality is medium-bad.</li>
<li>Super VideoCD: a CD with VBR MPEG-2 video at a resolution of 480x480 pixels (480x576 with PAL) and
video bitrates between 500 and 2600 kbits/second. The quality is comparable to LaserDisc, and a 80-minutes CD
can contain about 60 minutes con compressed video/audio (more if you reduce the bitrate, but with less
quality). Is compatible with a lot of DVD players, but maybe there is one very cheap which doesn't support it.
Video quality is good.</li>
<li>CVD (China Video Disk): identical to Super VideoCD, but with a resolution of 352x480 pixels (352x576
with PAL). Offers less artifacts with same bitrate, but image is a bit less sharper than Super VideoCD. Is
compatible with a lot of DVD players, but maybe there is one very cheap which doesn't support it.</li>
<li>DIVX/MPEG4: creates one-pass DIVX files, ready to be played in DIVX-compliant players.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Of course you aren't limited to theses options, since you can choose, if you want, another resolution
for your CD/DVD. This allows you to create Super VideoCDs with a resolution of 352x240 (or 352x288 for PAL),
which is a very good compromise if you want to store a lot of video in a single CD. I don't recomend to use
other resolutions with VideoCDs, because CBR MPEG-1 is very limited. Choose the Super VideoCD or CVD option
(which uses VBR MPEG-2) and use there the resolution you want.</p>

<h3>The main interface</h3>

<p>After choosing the kind of disk you want, you will see the main interface:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main.jpg" /><br/><h5>Main interface for DVD discs</h5></div></p>

<p>A DVD is divided in <b>Titles</b> and <b>Chapters</b>. Each title is a film on its own, and,
when played, you have to choose the one you want to see. Into each title you can add as many files
you want, and cut them in chapters to allow an easy search.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main2.jpg" /><br/><h5>Main interface for VCD/SVCD/CVD discs</h5></div></p>

<p>In VideoCDs, Super VideoCDs and CVDs there's no title concept, so that frame won't be visible when you
choose to create one of them.</p>

<p>In the DVD window screenshot we can see that there are two titles, and that title two has two files.
The files in a title will be played one after another, like a single film. So if you only want to
create a DVD with one single film from multiple files, you have to put all of them in a single title. Your
player will merge all in a single film.</p>

<p>The <b>File info</b> box contains all the information about the selected file: desired audio an video
rate, original size, FPS and length in seconds. It has the estimated size in Mbytes, but have in mind
that is an estimation, so the final size can be lower.</p>

<p>The <b>Disk usage</b> shows the percentage of the DVD currently used. You can occupy more than the
100% because it's based in an estimation, so the final size can (and probably will) be lower than the
espected, but never higher. You can choose the CD/DVD size too. Have in mind another thing: a 700MB CD can contain 80 minutes
of compressed audio/video, which, at 1152 kbps are about 800MB. This means that, when the media is a CD,
you MUST use the bar to know how many disc space you are using, and no the estimated size of the files,
because you can put up to 800MB of compressed video in a 700MB CD, or about 720MB in a 650MB CD.</p>

<p>Now, the <b>Action</b> block allows you to choose what do you want to create. The first option,<b>Only
convert film files to compliant MPEG files</b> takes each file and converts it to a DVD-compliant MPEG-PS
file, or to VCD, SVCD or CVD-compliant MPEG-PS. You can choose a generic name, being the default name "movie",
so the files will have names like <b>movie_XX_YY.mpg</b>, being XX the title, and YY the file position
into the title. An example: if you have two titles, and two files in the first title and three files at
the second title, you will get five files: movie_01_01.mpg, movie_01_02.mpg, movie_02_01.mpg,
movie_02_02.mpg and movie_02_03.mpg. This option is specially usefull when you want to create DVD menus
with other program like <a href="http://dvdstyler.sourceforge.net/">DVD Styler</a>,
<a href="http://qdvdauthor.sourceforge.net/">Q DVD Author</a> or
<a href="http://polidori.sourceforge.net/">PoliDori</a>. Of course, with VCD, SVCD or CVD, the title
number will be always "01".</p>

<p>The second option, <b>Create disk structure</b>, is visible only when you create a DVD. It creates the
MPEG files and then uses DVDAuthor to create the DVD tree structure. After that, it erases the MPEG files.
You can use this option to create the folder and files for a DVD and use your own DVD recording program
to create the ISO image and burn it into a DVD.</p>

<p>The third option, (second if you are creating a VCD, SVCD or CVD), <b>Create an ISO or BIN/CUE image,
ready to burn to a disk</b>, converts the files to MPEG, creates the DVD tree if needed and, using
<b>MKISOFS</b>, creates the ISO file, erasing then the MPEG and DVD tree to free disk space. With CD media,
it converts the files to MPEG and uses <b>VCDImager</b> to create a BIN/CUE image, ready to be burned
to a CD. Use this option to create a disk image ready to be burned to a CD/DVD with a program like
<a href="http://gnomebaker.sourceforge.net/">GnomeBaker</a> or <a href="http://www.k3b.org">K3b</a>.</p>

<p>The next block, options, starts with <b>Erase temporary files</b>, which allows to choose if you want
DeVeDe to erase the temporary files as soon as they are needed no more. Selecting it, DeVeDe will need
only about twice the final disk space, but if you don't mark it, you will need about three times the final
disk space, but you will have all the temporary files.</p>

<h3>Menu options</h3>

<p>Finally there is the <b>Add a menu with the titles</b> and its asociated buttons. When you check it,
DeVeDe will create a menu in the DVD, allowing you to jump to the title you want. Here is the menu that
DeVeDe creates from the example, with the first title highlighted:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>If you click the <b>Menu options</b> button, you will see this window:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_opts.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>The first block allows you to change the background picture. This way you can create a custom menu
for your DVD. In the second block you can choose the format for your menu (PAL or NTSC). This determines
the final resolution (720x576 for PAL or 720x480 for NTSC). The third block allows you to change the font style
and size, but be carefull: you can only change the font size, not the button size, so if you make it too big,
you will have a menu like this:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_bad.jpg" /><br/>You must be carefull with the font size, or
you will get incorrect results like this.</div></p>

<p>The optimal font size is 12 points, but maybe for some special fonts it can be different, so always
use the <b>Preview menu</b> button to ensure that everything has the desired size.</p>

<p>These options will be unavailable when creating DIVX files, because there you will create only files, not
disk images.</p>

<h3>Adding a new title</h3>

<p>If you press the button <b>Add</b> in the title group, DeVeDe will add a new title with a generic name.
Now, if you click the button <b>Properties</b>, you will see the title's properties window:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="title_prop.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>The first thing you can change here is the title's name. This is important because this name is the
one used in the menu.</p>

<p>The second thing you can choose is the action to perform when the player ends playing this title.
These options allows to choose the new title which the player will play. This way you can do a title
that loops forever, or you can do a disk which, after playing any title, plays the last title too and then
jumps to the menu... the possibilites are infinite :)</p>

<p>With the arrow keys you can reorder the titles.</p>

<p>Currently you can create DVD discs with up to 12 titles.</p>

<h3>Adding movie files to a title</h3>

<p>To add a new file you have two options: first, you can drag and drop one or more files into the main
window, so DeVeDe will give them some fine default values; or you can choose the "Add" button, so you will see
this window:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie1.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>First you choose the file you want to add (you can do it by drag and drop in this window too). After
doing it, you can see its properties at the <b>File info</b> block. You can then choose the new audio an
video rate, unless you are creating a VCD (theses have a fixed data rate). Remember that bigger rates will
give you more quality, but bigger file size too.</p>

<p>By default, if the video will be reescaled to a width of 720 pixels, DeVeDe will put 5001Mbps; but
if the final width is 352, DeVeDe will put 2001Mbps by default if final height is 288 (PAL) or 240 (NTSC),
or 3001Mbps if final height is 576 (PAL) or 480 (NTSC). Of course you can change this value to the one you
want in order to have more quality or more playing time.</p>

<p>Then, you can choose if you want to put the whole file, or only the first or the second half. This is
specially usefull when creating VCDs: you can cut a long film in two disks if it's too long to fit in
a single disk. But if the length of the film is less than 60 seconds, you won't be able to choose them.</p>

<p>Remember that this option is applied to each file, so if you put two files in a xCD and choose in
both the first half, you will have a xCD with the first half of the first file followed by the first half
of the second file.</p>

<p>Finally, you can choose if you want to create a PAL/SECAM or a NTSC DVD. DeVeDe will remember the last
option you used, even between sessions, so you can choose it once and forget it.</p>

<p>Maybe you ask why I put this option here and not in the main window. The answer is: because this way
you can create hybrid DVDs, with some films in PAL/SECAM format and others in NTSC. What is the utility
of this? Simply: modern TV sets and DVD players can play both formats, so if you manually choose the one
that fits better the original framerate of the file, you will have an smoother video. This is:
if the original file has 24 or 25 fps, select PAL, and if it has 30 fps, select NTSC. Of course you can
force one of them and DeVeDe will adjust the framerate to 25 or 30 fps, ensuring that the DVD will have
the rigth framerate and will play fine in all TV sets, but maybe the motion is not as smooth as it could
be.</p>

<p>There's a <b>Preview</b> button that converts some seconds (you can choose how many), allowing you to
check the audio/video quality and the audio sync. It will create the temporary file by default at
<b>/var/tmp</b>, but you can choose other place if you preffer.</p>

<p>Finally there's an expansor named <b>Advanced options</b>. If you expand it, you will see that there are
four tabs with new options, not needed normally but which can give much more control to advanced users:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie2.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>In the <b>Video options</b> tab you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Final size</b>: allows you to change the final resolution. A bigger resolution will give you
sharper pictures, but will need more bitrate to avoid the horrible MPEG artifacs. If you choose <b>Default</b>,
DeVeDe will choose automagically the best resolution, based in the original video resolution and the disk
format you wanted. For Video DVD, DeVeDe will use resolutions of 352x288 for PAL/SECAM, or 352x240 for NTSC, if the video's
resolution is smaller or equal than that. If not, it will jump to 352x480 (NTSC) or 352x576 (PAL) if this
way the video fits. If not, it will use 720x576 for PAL/SECAM or 720x480 for NTSC. For VCD, SuperVCD or CVD,
DeVeDe will use, as default, the standard resolution of each format. If the video rate is 5001, 3001 or 2001,
it will choose a new videorate automatically too.</li>

<li><b>Scaling mode</b>: here you can choose the expand method to use when the aspect ratio of the original file is not 4/3.
The first method is the preferred, and consists in adding the classic black bars up and down. It has the
advantage of maintain the aspect ratio, so the faces will look natural. The alternative method consists
in expand the film, so the faces will look enlarged. Of course, if you have a 16:9 TV you can put it to
Full Screen, and enjoy a full-resolution panoramic film.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Use 16:9 aspect ratio for output</b>: if this option is marked, the video will be adjusted to an
aspect ratio of 16:9 instead the classic 4:3. If you have a television with widescreen, this option will allow
you to enjoy more your videos thanks to the extra vertical resolution. This option is marked automatically
when the source file has an aspect ratio of 1.777777 or bigger, but you can change it in the case you
want pure 4:3 output or if DeVeDe fails to detect a widescreen video.</li>

<li>Have in mind that the DVD standard only allows to create a 16:9 DVD with a width of 720 pixels, so
if you activate this option, DeVeDe will ensure that the final width will be 720. For the same reason, if
you choose a different width, the 16:9 option will be deactivated.</li>

<li>You can create 16:9 DVDs, but not 16:9 VCDs, SVCDs or CVDs.</li>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie3.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>In the <b>Quality options</b> tab you have:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Trellis Searched Quantization</b>: this option makes Mencoder to find the optimal encoding for each
8x8 block, giving more video quality at the cost of a little slower conversion.</li>

<li><b>MacroBlock decision algorithm</b>: allows to choose the MBD algorithm, so you can choose to
have better quality at the cost of slower conversion.</li>

<li><b>Deinterlacing</b>: allows to apply a deinterlace algorithm to the video. Useful when creating
a DVD from a TV program or TV camera. You have three different algoritms to choose.</li>

</ul>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie4.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>The <b>Audio delay</b> box is used to adjust the audio/video sync, allowing to fix videos with audio out
of sync. You can set positive or negative values.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie6.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>In the <b>Subtitles</b> tab you can choose a file with external subtitles, which will be added to the
current video. These subtitles will be stored as true DVD subtitles, so you will be able to activate or
remove them while playing. If you are using subtitle files coded with a codepage different than ISO-8859-1 (or pure
ASCII) you will have to choose the right Codepage (UTF-8 is twice to make it easier to find).</p>
<p>The option "Put subtitles upper" makes DeVeDe to render the subtitles a little upper that normally. This
is fine when you have a 16:9 film in 3:4 format (with black bars up and down) and want to use the ZOOM option
in your TV without loosing the subtitles, or when your TV is old and misses too many lines in bottom and
cuts the ordinary subtitles.</p>
<p>Have in mind that if you preview a video from DeVeDe with subtitles, they will be shown in order to allow
you to ensure that the sincronization is fine (needs MPlayer 1.0rc1 or later, and not always works :( ).</p>

<p>If you want to remove the file, just use the <b>Clear</b> button.</p>

<p>Currently you can't add subtitles when creating DIVX files, so this tab will be unavailable in that mode.
But if you put the subtitles in the same directory than your DIVX file, usually the player should show them.
<a href="faq.html">Read the FAQ for details</a>.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="movie5.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>In the <b>Misc</b> tab you have:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Division in chapters</b>: available only with Video DVDs, allows you to divide the file in
chapters each X minutes, so if you choose 5 minutes, you will have a chapter each 5 minutes. You can
choose different intervals for each file. Is a good practice to divide files in chapters, because that
allows you to easily jump to the desired part of the DVD. I hope to add this feature to CD media soon.</li>

<li><b>Special</b>: this section contains the <b>This file is already a DVD/xCD-suitable MPEG-PS file</b> option.
When marked, nearly all options will became insensitive because DeVeDe will not recompress that file, but
will use it directly when creating the DVD/xCD structure. This option is usefull when you have some
already-compressed files (Eg. when you capture a TV signal and store it directly in MPEG2-PS format), because
you will not need to wait the conversion time. Of course, you can mix MPEG-PS and non-MPEG-PS files in the
same disc, because DeVeDe will recompress the non-MPEG-PS files, and use directly the MPEG-PS ones.</li>

<li><p><b>Extra parameters for Mencoder</b>: allows you to add extra parameters to <b>Mencoder</b>, allowing
you to add hardcoded subtitles, set picture quality, and much more. Remember to use '\ ' to put blank spaces.
An example: <b>-sub /home/raster/holidays\ at\ galicia.sub</b> will hard render the subtitles
in the file "holidays at galicia.sub". The blank spaces at the filename are put as '\ '.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Creating the disk</h3>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="create.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>After adding all the files you want, you will be prompted for a directory where DeVeDe will create all
the files, and a generic name for them. The directory must have sufficient free space to hold all the
temporary files (aprox. the double of the final CD/DVD size). The generic name will be used to name all
the temporary files, so the MPEG files will be named as GENERICNAME_XX_YY.MPG, the DVD tree directory will
be named GENERICNAME, the ISO image will be named GENERICNAME.ISO, and the BIN/CUE files will be
GENERICNAME.BIN and GENERICNAME.CUE. You can't use blank spaces for this name (if you put them, will be
changed to underscores).</p>

<p>Finally, the program will start to create the files. Remember that this is a very slow process, and can
need more than two hours to be completed.</p>

<h3>Storing and restoring the disc structure</h3>

<p>The options <b>Load</b>, <b>Save</b> and <b>Save as</b> in the <b>File</b> menu allow you to save
the current disk structure, in the case that you want continue your work later, or reuse it for another,
slightly different, disk. DeVeDe stores the disk format adding the extension <b>.devede</b>.</p>

<p>When you load a disk structure, DeVeDe checks that every file is still in its place. If there is a missing,
it will show an error message listing all the missing files (the complete path) and will refuse to load the
structure, to avoid incorrect results. There's a trick to still load it: just copy another movie to the
right directory and rename it with the right name, and after loading the structure, remove it from DeVeDe.</p>

<p>If the missing file is the menu background, DeVeDe will load the structure anyway, but showing a warning
message and using the default background instead.</p>

<p><h2>Installing DeVeDe in your Home</h2></p>

<p>DeVeDe 1.1 and later can be installed in other directories, like your own home directory. This allows
to use DeVeDe in machines where you don't have root access. To do so, just copy the files:</p>

<ul>
<li>devede.py</li>
<li>devede.glade</li>
<li>barras.png</li>
<li>estira.png</li>
<li>devedesans.ttf</li>
<li>devede_bincue.py</li>
<li>devede_executor.py</li>
<li>devede_subtitles.py</li>
<li>devede_convert.py</li>
<li>devede_gtk_helper.py</li>
<li>devede_video_convert.py</li>
<li>devede_delete.py</li>
<li>devede_other.py</li>
<li>devede_xml_menu.py</li>
<li>devede_dvd.py</li>

</ul>

<p>into a folder, and run devede.py from that directory ("barras.png" and "estira.png" are in the "pixmaps"
directory).</p>
