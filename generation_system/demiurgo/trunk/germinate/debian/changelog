germinate (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * When processing whole-source seed entries, only include real packages.
    This avoids slews of warnings for binaries that only exist on other
    architectures, and avoids mistakenly picking up virtual packages.

germinate (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix recommends-related changelog entries from update-metapackage.

germinate (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crash when promoting from lesser seeds.
  * Include recommends in main outputs (they should continue to appear in
    Task headers and such, just not in metapackage dependencies), and create
    a .seed-recommends output for just the seeded recommendations.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 15:28:57 +0100

germinate (0.21ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

  * added support for recommends in seeds via enclosing the
    packagename in '('..')'. E.g. 
    * (pkgname)     # this will produce a recommends

germinate (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add optional output_seeds setting (defaults to value of seeds) in
    update.cfg, to allow seeds to be germinated for inheritance purposes
    without being output.
  * Sort added and removed packages in metapackage changelogs.

germinate (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Consider sources from inner seeds while rescuing packages from extra (so
    e.g. in Ubuntu Extra-Include in supported should look at source packages
    from minimal etc. as well as from supported).
  * Rescue from sources in the build tree in a separate pass, and add
    rescued packages to the depends/build-depends lists rather than
    pretending that they're explicitly seeded. This means that rescued
    packages end up correctly in supported or supported+build-depends
    depending on whether their source packages were found while processing
    dependencies or build-dependencies.

germinate (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow shell-style globs in seeds wherever regular expressions are
    allowed. (Regular expressions are surrounded by /.../, making this
    unambiguous.)
  * Add support for Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude variables, which allow
    automatically rescuing packages that match certain patterns from extra
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/seed-cleanup).
  * Tweak logging priorities for messages about virtual seed entries.
  * Don't display debugging messages by default; add germinate -v/--verbose
    option to display them.
  * Use sets rather than lists where possible. This roughly halves the
    runtime for the Ubuntu seeds.
  * Add extras recursively: binaries generated by sources pulled in by
    dependencies or build-dependencies of extra binaries should themselves
    be extra.

germinate (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to python-support.
  * Move python and python-support build-dependencies to
    Build-Depends-Indep.
  * Policy version 3.7.2.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Jul 2006 12:33:24 +0100

germinate (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix d-i kernel version pruning to happen early enough to exclude seeded
    packages for the wrong kernel version (which can easily happen e.g. if
    regex seeds are used).
  * If no Kernel-Version variable is given, allow all udebs with
    Kernel-Version headers rather than none of them.
  * Change default distribution to edgy.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jun 2006 18:10:40 +0100

germinate (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --bzr option to automatically check out seeds from bzr.
  * Switch from urllib to urllib2.
  * Refactor duplicated seed-fetching code into new Germinate.seeds module.
  * Add optional seed_dist setting in update.cfg files, to allow setting a
    default seed distribution.
  * Add --bzr option to update-metapackage as well (mostly implementing
    https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-meta-from-bzr).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 12:15:01 +0100

germinate (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Source moved to bzr; update copyright file.
  * Add germinate-update-metapackage script to help manage updating
    ubuntu-meta et al (thanks, Gustavo Franco; closes:
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/37917).
  * Improve man page documentation of --seed-packages slightly (see
    #363536).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 01:04:21 +0100

germinate (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move Python modules to /usr/lib/germinate; .pyc/.pyo files are
    architecture-dependent.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 13 May 2006 10:05:37 +0100

germinate (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

germinate (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to Debian (closes: #360631).
  * Switch to my debian.org maintainer address.

germinate (0.11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix plantSeed() backward incompatibility for *-meta/update scripts by
    defaulting seedrelease to None.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 15:56:35 +0000

germinate (0.10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add seed distribution name to seed descriptions in the "Why" column.

germinate (0.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * When processing the build tree, germinate is (correctly) careful not to
    promote packages from lesser seeds, since we still want to consider them
    (e.g.) part of ship even if they're build-dependencies of desktop.
    However, this sometimes caused us to select the wrong alternative from
    an or-ed build-dependency (e.g. redland Build-Depends:
    libmysqlclient15-dev | libmysqlclient12-dev | libmysqlclient10-dev and
    libmysqlclient15-dev was in the Ubuntu supported seed). To fix this,
    process the packages at that point anyway and just avoid promoting them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 20 Feb 2006 13:51:30 +0000

germinate (0.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * When identifying extras, check for binaries built from multiple source
    packages and skip any superseded binaries.
  * Change default for --components to main and restricted, since the Ubuntu
    seeds rely on packages from restricted in order to germinate correctly.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 12:11:24 +0000

germinate (0.7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Depend on python-apt (thanks, Jani Monoses).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 29 Nov 2005 19:23:45 +0000

germinate (0.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add regular expression support in seeds. Weaken architecture
    specification error checking in order to be able to use [...] in regular
    expressions more easily.
  * Add support for including all the binaries from a given source package
    (using "%source") in seeds.
  * Add germinate --cleanup option, to prevent caching of Packages and
    Sources files.
  * Add germinate --source-mirror option, to allow Packages and Sources
    files to be on different mirrors (e.g. Ubuntu ports architectures).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 16 Nov 2005 14:37:37 +0000

germinate (0.5) dapper; urgency=high

  * Stop accidentally including extra in the all and supported+build-depends
    outputs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 30 Oct 2005 12:35:47 -0500

germinate (0.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't attempt to satisfy versioned dependencies of .debs using virtual
    packages, as the packaging toolchain doesn't support that. (udpkg/anna
    do support this for .udebs, and the installer relies on that.)
  * Change default distribution to dapper.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 12:14:07 +0100

germinate (0.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add a man page for germinate.
  * Explain in pkg-diff --help that you can supply a list of seeds to
    compare against as non-option arguments.
  * Update pkg-diff's default seeds to 'minimal standard desktop', to match
    the breezy seeds.
  * Add germinate --seed-packages option, to allow calculating dependencies
    of individual extra packages during a germinate run.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 18:47:20 +0100

germinate (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix formatting of output lines with UTF-8 maintainer strings.
  * Really pick the first reason from the build-dependency tree to display
    in output files.
  * Record allowed d-i kernel versions on a per-seed basis, so that we can
    have some kernel versions supported for netboot installations only.
  * Force a trailing slash onto the end of any --seed-source argument.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 26 May 2005 16:32:38 +0100
