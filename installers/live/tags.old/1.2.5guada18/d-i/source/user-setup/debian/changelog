user-setup (1.2ubuntu4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Backport from trunk (closes: Malone #50036):
    - Detect and error out on reserved usernames, i.e. those that are
      already used by some parts of the system. Unfortunately there's no
      particularly straightforward way to identify a reserved username, and
      the only way I can think of is to maintain a blacklist; so I've
      collated this from the base-passwd master files and those user and
      group names I found on some of my systems. Feel free to extend this as
      the need arises.
  * Backport from trunk (Christian Perrier):
    - Spell "username" consistently.
  * Update translations from trunk.
